# build1replate

Many businesses have leftover food at the end of the day. Replate lets them post those extras and have a volunteer come pick up the food and take it to a predetermined place of need.

The Homepage feautres the Navigation bar at the top of the page while the Get Started button is used to navigate the site from the homepage. (MVP2)

Upon clicking the Get Started button, 3 sign-up options are given:

1. Sign up for business owners
2. Sign up for volunteers
3. Sign up for non-profit organizations (MVP1 and 2 + Stretch)

After business owners sign up to the Replate site, they get taken to the dashboard that features the summary of their details as well as the ability to schedule a pickup request, including details such as how much food, type of food. (MVP3)

Whilst still on the dashboard, the business owners can easily edit a pickup request or delete them by a popup modal. (MVP4)

The Replate team also have the ability to find all local business that have signed up and view all the requests for each day. This is made possible by the business list page which is designed as a tab with the daily request page (MVP5)

A volunteer can also decide to accept or reject a pickup request. This can be seen on the accept request page. Upon clicking view details of the pick up, 2 button: reject or accept are given to them to choose from. (MVP6)

The entire website was UI designed by me, Esther Agbaje using Figma. Here is the link to the design: https://www.figma.com/file/mExIDrzNv3ZqkOFUsLLUX3/Lambda-School-Build-Week-1-Design?node-id=135%3A1

The site was also made to be both desktop and mobile responsive for ease of use.
